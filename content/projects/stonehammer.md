        Stone Hammer Music was a small website I wrote to host my uncle's old
        music. It's completely hand-written HTML, CSS and JS, and the icons at
        the bottom are each one element, completely shaped with CSS.

        Some features include: filtering songs by album, different playback
        methods (shuffle, play next, repeat), skipping around to different parts
        of a song using a live progress bar at the bottom of the screen, and
        being quick to load in the web browser.
