        This idea stemmed from an activity I participated in in my University's
        CS Discord server: Resume Roasts. Basically, anyone could upload their
        resume to the groupchat, then everyone would "roast" it, and give them
        a bunch of feedback to improve.

        Resume Roast is a React based webapp which integrates Dropbox's OAuth API
        for storage of users resumes, and Disqus embedded community management to
        handle the comment section for each document. It has a REST API which
        interfaces with the SQLite database, OAuth tokens, and generated
        thumbnails to pragmatically serve data to the React app.
