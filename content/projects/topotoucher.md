        Written in C++ using OpenGL, TopoToucher is a heightmap sandbox program
        that gives you the power of pushing points on a grid up and down to
        create interesting terrain visualizations. The fun part comes with the
        variable area-of-effect and different rolloff functions available to you.

        TopoToucher uses many keyboard controls, so make sure to check the
        README.md file or read the post before trying out the program. I'll 
        write about how the program works, some problems I overcame writing it,
        and the features I'd like to implement in the future.
