        Shortlinks is a simple webserver written in JavaScript ran with Bun
        which utilizes HTTP status codes and an SQLite database to redirect
        short urls to longer ones.

    - >-
        It has a REST API which takes POST requests to create these redirects
        with the option of randomly generating the short url, or requesting a
        specific code. Additionally, Shortlinks serves a simple web interface
        for the API which is styled with [Pico.css](https://picocss.com), and 
        there is also a CLI application interface written in Go.
