        I wrote the website for Bonita Rose Jewelry in 2021 using Square Online,
        imported all of their products from Etsy, and set up the payment system
        to sync with their accounts already using Square for in-person sales.

        In addition to setting up the website, one of my biggest tasks was
        importing all relevant information from Etsy. I used Python to assemble
        the new CSV product database and programatically download all product
        images.
