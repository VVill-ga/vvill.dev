        I wrote the website for Bonita Rose Jewelry in 2021 using Square Online,
        imported all of their products from Etsy, and set up the payment system
        to sync with their accounts already using Square for in-person sales.

        One of my biggest tasks for this project was importing all relevant 
        information from the existing Etsy store. I used Python to assemble
        the new CSV product database and programmatically download all product
        images into folders named after the product's SKU.
