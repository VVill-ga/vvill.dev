        Newsie is a browser-based party game like Kahoot or the Jackbox series
        of games. Players are prompted with a news headline, and are given a
        short amount of time to find or take a funny picture to accompany it,
        and then vote on eachothers to determine the best fit.

        This game was written with a HTML/CSS/JS frontend and a Node.js backend
        as a final project for an introduction to web development course at OSU.
        It utilizes webhooks to traffic data between clients and the server, and
        object-oriented design to manage games on the backend. My team members 
        were [Joshua Brown](https://joshuabrown419.com), [Sandy
        Patil](https://sankalpspatil.netlify.app), and [Bradley
        Rule](https://github.com/Redbadger10).
