          In short, a handwritten site with a Gruvbox like theme, statically 
          compiled by Hugo, hosted by Caddy on an Arch Linux VPS, with DNS and 
          traffic routed through Cloudflare.

          This website has been a work in progress for many years, and has
          gone through many a wardrobe change. I'll talk about my decision 
          against using a fancy framework like React or Bootstrap, design
          principles I followed, plans for the future, and my biggest takeaways
          from finishing such a big project.

## The Story So Far

## Design Principles

### Simplicity

### Modularity

### Me-ity

Simplic**ity**, Modular**ity**, and Me...*ity*. My final design principle was
simply to do whatever I wanted to! I see this website as a reflection of my
self, so I wanted 

## Site Structure

### Home Page

### Post Page

### Other Features

```js
function calcVh(){
	document.documentElement.style.setProperty('--vh', (window.innerHeight * 0.01) + "px");
}
```

## Future Plans

### Search/Filter Posts

### Dynamically Load Posts

### Plausible Analytics

### Decentralized Comments

I'm not entirely sure how this one will work yet, but I'd like to offer a "comment
section" under my project breakdowns and blog posts. One one hand, I don't want to
rely on a 3rd party service like Disqus, but at the same time it would feel silly 
to have readers have a whole account and "sign in" to vvill.dev. I haven't done too
much research yet, but one idea I have is to use Matrix to allow people to use their
self-hosted account, discord account, etc.
