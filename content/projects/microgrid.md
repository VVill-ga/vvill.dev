        The final project for Engineering 102 was to "create a program that
        solves a problem". This was an introduction to programming class, and I
        didn't realize "solving a problem" could be as simple as summing two 
        numbers and returning the output.

        Partnered with [Joshua Brown](https://joshuabrown419.com) and [Bradley
        Rule](https://github.com/Redbadger10), our program takes in a node 
        network of distribution centers and endpoints, and balances the 
        electrical load between nodes. The output is an easy to read png with a 
        visualization of the network and instructions for the movement of 
        electricity at the bottom.
