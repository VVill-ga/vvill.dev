          My name is Will, it's nice to meet you! Or, nice to have you meet me. 
          I am a Junior and self-proclaimed 'Student Leader' studying Computer Science at Oregon State University. Go Beavs!

          You can learn more about me using the dropdown at the top of the card 
          (on mobile), or the options to the left (on desktop). If you keep 
          scrolling, you'll find overviews of some of my side-projects, 
          and a blog I sometimes write to.
