          Since high school I have been involved in clubs and in building 
          communities. Today at OSU, I help run 6 student organizations: 
          the Residence Hall Association, the Engineering Student Council, 
          the Linux Users Group, the Video Game Development Club, the 
          Karate Club, and the General Engineering Club, which I helped 
          found.
