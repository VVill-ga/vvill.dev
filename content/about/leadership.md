          Since high school I have been involved in club leadership and building 
          communities. Today at OSU, I help run 6 student organizations: 
          the Residence Hall Association, the Engineering Student Council, 
          the Linux Users Group, the Video Game Development Club, the 
          Karate Club, and the General Engineering Club, which I helped 
          start.

          This year I am running for Vice-President of the Associated 
          Students of Oregon State University. Once the campaign period 
          starts, you will be able to learn more about this venture at the link 
          below.
