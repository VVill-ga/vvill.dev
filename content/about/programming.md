            I was introduced to the world of computer science through video game
            mods and game development. In high school, I took all the computer
            classes they offered, and learned web development and OOP with Java. 
            Now I am studying at OSU and have become very experienced with web 
            development, C/C++, graphics programming, and proper programming 
            practices and techniques.

            In the meantime, I've worked on many side projects, several of which
            evolving into or from class projects, learned the Rust programming
            language using the official book and forums, taught myself to use
            Blender for 3D model creation and editing through YouTube videos,
            and learned to use many tools to improve my programming efficiency.
